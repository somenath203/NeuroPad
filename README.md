## 📌 NOTE

To get accurate responses about any note, always use the **exact title** of the note in the chat with AI. This includes the exact words and casing.

For example:  
If the note title is **"First App"**, always refer to it as **"First App"** in your queries, not **"first App"** or **"first app"**.
